# Authentication & Role Management Design

## 1. Authentication Approach

- **OAuth2:** Integration with enterprise identity providers (Google, Azure AD, Okta)
- **JWT:** Secure session management for API and frontend
- **Login Flow:** User authenticates via OAuth2, receives JWT for subsequent requests

## 2. User Roles

- **Admin:** Full access to all features, user and plugin management
- **Analyst:** Can run queries, view analytics, use plugins
- **Viewer:** Read-only access to dashboards and analytics

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **API Endpoints:** Protected by role checks (e.g., /admin/* for admins only)
- **Frontend Features:** UI components rendered based on user role
- **Permissions Matrix:** Mapping of roles to allowed actions

## 4. Security Considerations

- **Token Expiry & Refresh:** Short-lived JWTs, refresh tokens for session extension
- **Audit Logging:** Track authentication events and access attempts
- **Passwordless Option:** Support for SSO and passwordless login via OAuth2

## 5. Implementation Notes

- **FastAPI:** Use fastapi-users or custom middleware for OAuth2/JWT
- **React:** Store JWT securely (httpOnly cookies or secure local storage)
- **Testing:** Automated tests for auth flows and RBAC
