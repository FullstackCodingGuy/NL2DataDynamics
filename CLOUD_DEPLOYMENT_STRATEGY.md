# Cloud Deployment Strategy â€“ Agentic Analytics Tool

## 1. Containerization

- **Docker:** Separate containers for backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React)
- **Docker Compose:** For local development and multi-container orchestration

---

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure Pipelines
- **Steps:** Build, test, lint, security scan, push to registry, deploy to cloud
- **Artifacts:** Docker images stored in cloud registry (AWS ECR, Azure Container Registry, GCP Artifact Registry)

---

## 3. Cloud Providers

- **AWS:** ECS (Fargate/EKS), RDS for managed databases, S3 for static assets
- **Azure:** Web Apps, Azure SQL, Blob Storage
- **GCP:** Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage

---

## 4. Configuration & Secrets Management

- **Environment Variables:** For DB credentials, API keys, LLM endpoints
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager

---

## 5. Networking & Security

- **HTTPS:** Enforce TLS for all endpoints
- **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to DB and internal APIs
- **IAM Roles:** Least privilege for cloud resources

---

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

- **Monitoring:** Cloud-native tools (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations)
- **Logging:** Centralized log aggregation (ELK, cloud logging services)
- **Alerts:** Automated alerts for failures, security events

---

## 7. Scaling & High Availability

- **Auto-scaling:** Based on CPU/memory usage
- **Load Balancing:** Cloud-native load balancers
- **Redundancy:** Multi-zone deployment for high availability

---

## 8. Deployment Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to repository
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests code
3. Docker images are published to registry
4. Cloud provider pulls images and deploys containers
5. Environment variables and secrets are injected at runtime
